  <h2>Why We Should Recycle Computer Components</h2>

  <p>Computer parts have dangerous materials that can affect the environment. Not many people know that it has one of the biggest impacts on our environment. Electronic waste (e-waste) only takes up 2% of our landfills but accounts for 70% of our total toxic waste production. The waste would affect the groundwater which can lead to cancer and organ damage. As electronics become more relevant today, it will lead to more waste. In 2016, there were almost 50 million tons of e-waste produced, and because of the steady increase of this waste type. So much waste is produced by new developments in technology.

  <h2>Benefits to Recycling</h2>
  <div style="text-align: left">
    <p>If everybody contributes to recycling electronics it will benefit the environment but also for us. Recycling e-waste can create jobs. Reusing and recycling electronic devices can save on energy consumption across the map, the task still requires people to perform labor and logistics. Because of this, electronic waste recycling can be a significant economic benefit since producing 10,000 tons of recycled material can create as many as 300 new jobs. Another benefit comes from saving resources from recycling old computer parts. Wires and other components of electronic devices made of aluminum and copper can be reused multiple times. Reutilizing them in other electronic devices means little to no material goes to waste. Less mining for ores and other natural resources for the new computer parts.

  <h2>How to Start Recycling </h2>
    <div style="text-align: left">
      <p>By having the users recycle their computer parts instead will help reduce the electronic waste. For example, if the user upgrades a computer part but the old component still works they can sell it online. Other people can buy your computer part and still use it. On Ebay you can either auction or list it as a price for others to buy and earn money back through paypal. Amazon also functions as an alternative place to sell or to recycle. If the computer parts stop working then the user should go to a recycling center that accepts electronic waste. Google the nearest recycling center that will accept electronics waste. Another suggestion is to google retailers near you that recycle electronic waste. Best Buy or Staples accepts electronic waste and will recycle them.
